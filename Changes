      transparent way.

0.02.1  Wed Mar 19
    - Aww!  I left in an incorrect NOTE section regarding a fix I had

0.04  Sat Aug  9 2003
    - Put the pm under lib/URI.
    - Made the icky globals object attributes.
    - Cleaned up the _traverse() code.
    - Enhanced the POD (eg. added the missing fetch_items() method).
    - Made the testscript actually do something useful!  More to come
      however...
    - Put the bookmarks and favorites (ones without spaces in
      filenames) in an eg/ directory.
    - Removed the perl version restriction.

0.05  Mon Aug 11 2003
    - Had to change the "file_mode" value in the favs for some
      mystery reason.  : (
    - Replaced the file and directory object attributed with
      links => [].
    - Moved the _traverse and _parse_file calls to the _init method.
    - Made _init handle the links arrayref.
    - Made fetch_items build and return a hashref instead of an
      arrayref.
    - Allowed fetch_items to resrict what is found with category,
      title and url arguments.
    - Added the _title_and_url method to make fetch_items less
      bloated looking.
    - Made _traverse accept a directory argument again.
    - Added \Q and \E to the category RE that strips off the path (in
      _traverse).
    - Added a 'Title' section to win IE favorites.
    - Made _parse_file accept a filename argument again.
    - Wrapped the Netscape::Bookmarks constructor in an eval (and
      croak with $@).
    - Fixed and enhanced the POD in numerous ways...
    - Fixed the WinIE favorites in various ways, to enhance testing.

0.06  Mon Aug 11 2003
    - Whoops! Updating the POD to reflect functionality might be a
      good idea -before- uploading to CPAN. : \

0.07  Mon Aug 11 2003
    - Replaced N::B::Alias=>0 with N::B::Link=>1.1, in the hope that
      "Josts Smokehouse" has an old version.  :-(

0.08  Tue Aug 12 2003
    - Nope.  That was not the answer.  LAMENESS.
    - Made a _matches function to simplify fetch_items.
    - Added an is_item method.
    - Drop the foolish and unnecessary saving of bookmark and
      favorites objects internally.
    - Return the bookmarks or favorites as a string or hash of string
      lists as well as writing them to disk. 
    - Use IO:String to handle the annoying
      Config::IniFiles::OutputConfig method.
    - Update and enhance POD with better usage examples, etc.
    - Added tests for all untested methods.
    - Suddenly, a n::b::category needs an id attribute... that is not
      even used, apparantly.
    - Added _debug calls to as_bm_file.
